An [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) comprehensive guide with PySpark.

#### Introduction

* MapReduce: distribituted processing framework. Allowed us to divide the data processing job in smaller tasks and utilize the cluster of computers to finish the individual tasks independently and combine the results after;
* Ingest Layer: bring data in it's raw format to the Data Lake; Tools: Kafka, AWS Glue, Talend, etc.
* Store Layer: HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure Blob, GCP Cloud;
* Process Layer: Initial data quality check, transforming and preparing data, correlating, aggregating, applying machine learning models; There is a division into
  - Data Processing Layer: **Apache Spark falls here**
  - Data Orchestration Layer: Managing resources of the cluster of distributed computation; **Hadoop YARN, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos**
* Consume Layer: Data Scientists, REST interfaces, file download, JDBC/ODBC, Search Engines;
* **Apache Spark**: 
  * Hadoop YARN Cluster Manager is the most used Resource Manager for the Spark Engine because it was first build with HDFS. But now we also have Kubernetes and Apache Mesos;
  * We also have Spark stand-alone resource managers;
  * Apache Spark does not offer Cluster Management and Storage Management. All you can do is run your data processing and this is managed by the Spark Compute Engine;
  * **Spark Engine**:
    * **Spark Engine** is responsible for breaking your data processing job in smaller tasks and schedule this tasks in the cluster for parallelization;
    * **Spark Engine** is responsible for managing and monitoring thoses tasks;
    * **Spark Engine** is responsible for providing fault-tolerance when a job fails;
    * **Spark Engine** is responsible for interacting with the Cluster Manager and Storage Manager;
  * **Spark Core**: Java, Scala, Python, R
